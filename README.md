# NASA_HRP_2019
Talk given at the 2019 NASA Human Research Program (HRP) Investigator's Workshop held in Galveston, Texas on January 22 -25, 2019. Concerns synergy theory methods applied to simulated galactic cosmic ray (GCR) mixed-field radiation. Demonstrates the use of incremental effect additivity (IEA) to screen for synergy or antagonism in mixed radiation field effects.
